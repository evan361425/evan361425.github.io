# Nginx from 1.18.0 to 1.22.1

Nginx using [calendar versioning](https://calver.org), and it release stable version every 2 years.

If you are wondering what changes between 1.18 and 1.20 then you can see all changes in 1.19.
The reason 1.22 has additional version (1.22.1) is because CVE
([CVE-2022-41741](https://www.google.com/search?client=safari&rls=en&q=CVE-2022-41741&ie=UTF-8&oe=UTF-8),
[CVE-2022-41742](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2022-41742))

Message prefix **üëÅÔ∏è** is change that I think it is important.

You can grep the messages by raw changes: [by-versions](#by-versions)
or by structured: [by-module](#by-module)/[by-protocols](#by-protocols)/[others](#global).

## Global

Security:

-   1-byte memory overwrite might occur during DNS server response processing if the `resolver` directive was used, allowing an attacker who is able to forge UDP packets from the DNS server to cause worker process crash or, potentially, arbitrary code execution ([CVE-2021-23017](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2021-23017)).
